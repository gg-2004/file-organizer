# File Organizer

This is a Python project that helps you automatically organize your files into folders based on their type.
For example:

Images → go into Images folder

Documents → go into Documents folder

Music → go into Music folder

Others → go into Others folder

 ## How it works

The program opens a window.

You can choose any folder from your computer.

When you click Organize Files, all the files inside that folder are moved into proper subfolders.

A progress box shows what is happening step by step.

At the end, you see "Done! Files organized successfully."
